  *
  * The ReadableStreamReader class represents a readable stream reader designed to be vended [sic] by a ReadableStream
  * instance.
  *
  * The ReadableStreamReader constructor is generally not meant to be used directly; instead, a stream’s getReader()
  * method should be used. This allows different classes of readable streams to vend different classes of readers
  * without the consumer needing to know which goes with which.
