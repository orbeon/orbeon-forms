/**
 * Base interface for processor input and outputs.
 *
 * NOTE 2010-07-05: the comment below is older than 2004-08-21 and is likely quite out of date. Most if not all
 * ProcessorOutput implementations either store a reference to their pipeline, or are inner classes of a pipeline. Could
 * this still apply to inputs but not outputs?
 *
 * "Why ProcessorInput and ProcessorOutput should not have a reference to their
 * corresponding processor?
 *
 * Some processors (A) create those objects and store them in cache. They can
 * be then be re-used by other processors (B) with the same configuration.
 * Obviously we don't want the ProcessorInput/ProcessorOutput to reference A
 * when it is being used by B. We could set the processor to B before running B.
 * However this doesn't work because the same configuration can be used by two
 * processors running at the same time. (This happens when an XPL makes a
 * recursive call.)
 *
 * Another option is to prevent processors from storing
 * ProcessorInput/ProcessorOutput in their configuration. This is incompatible
 * with the execution model of processors that execute (or "contain") other
 * processors. These processors store the contained processors in cache. In this
 * scenario, the processors stored in cache are connected to internal
 * ProcessorInput/ProcessorOutput, of course, also stored in cache. When
 * executed, the ProcessorOutput, also called "internal top output", find the
 * containing processor by using the processors stack stored in the
 * PipelineContext. Then the ProcessorOutput can read from the appropriate
 * input of the containing processor."
