        Create forms with Form Builder, the Orbeon Forms visual form designer. It allows you to build and deploy forms
        in minutes right from your web browser. Add form fields, including rich controls such as date, currency,
        file attachments and more. Group your fields in sections. Define validation logic, visibility rules, initial
        values. Pre-populate fields from Web or REST services. And there is more!
    </example>
    <example title="Form Runner Home" href="/fr/" img="/home/images/fr-home-small.jpg" size="4"
             source="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tadokoro/64402761/">
        See all deployed Form Runner forms. If you have administrative rights, you can also manage deployed forms from
        here.

        and generating great-looking PDF from templates.

    <example title="W-9 Form" href="/fr/orbeon/w9/edit/4a83b4cf2b905fbe105d7e57ddc5597b5e78c0a3" img="/home/images/form-w9-small.jpg" size="4"

        from a template.

        This sample form showcases all the form controls available out of the box in
        Form Builder. It also uses the wizard view to present a form as a series of separate pages.
    </example>
    <example title="Contact Form" href="/fr/orbeon/contact/summary" img="/home/images/form-contact-small.jpg" size="4"

        minutes as shown in the <xh:a href="http://www.orbeon.com/">Form Builder screencast</xh:a>.

        Form Builder is a powerful tool to create forms, but if you are a developer and you are
        considering to create forms by writing XForms by hand, see
        <xh:a href="/home/xforms">these examples coded in XForms</xh:a>.
