 * the datatable, which applies to parts of the date picker and prevents it from being completely hidden, as
 * visibility: hidden can be overridden by a descendant [1].

/**
 * Allows the date picker not to be clipped by the datatable
 *
 * The datatable defined a rule: .yui-dt-scrollable .yui-dt-hd { position:relative }. As a result, it clips the date
 * picker [1][2]. According to a comment in YUI's CSS, this rule is added to get around an IE bug where relatively
 * positioned content inside the datatable doesn't scroll and shows as fixed [3]. So here we want to keep that
 * workaround for IE, but but undo it on other browsers where it isn't necessary. As a result, the date picker is
 * clipped on IE (too bad, in some cases on IE users will need to scroll to reach it), but it isn't on other browsers.
