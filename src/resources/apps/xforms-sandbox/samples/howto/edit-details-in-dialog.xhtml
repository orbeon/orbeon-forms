                        <description>
                            Mercury (0.4 AU) is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet (0.055 Earth
                            masses). Mercury has no natural satellites, and its only known geological features besides
                            impact craters are lobed ridges or rupes, probably produced by a period of contraction early
                            in its history.[35] Mercury's almost negligible atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its
                            surface by the solar wind.[36] Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet
                            been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a
                            giant impact, and that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's
                            energy.[37][38]

                    <planet>
                        <name>Venus</name>
                        <description>
                            Venus (0.7 AU) is close in size to Earth, (0.815 Earth masses) and like Earth, has a thick
                            silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere and evidence of internal
                            geological activity. However, it is much drier than Earth and its atmosphere is ninety times
                            as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface
                            temperatures over 400 Â°C, most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the
                            atmosphere.[39] No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on
                            Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial
                            atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is regularly replenished by volcanic
                            eruptions.[40]

                        <description>
                            Earth (1 AU) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have
                            current geological activity, and is the only place in the universe where life is known to
                            exist.[41] Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is also
                            the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically
                            different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to
                            contain 21% free oxygen.[42] It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large
                            satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.

                        <description>
                            Mars (1.5 AU) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107 Earth masses). It possesses an
                            atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6
                            percent that of the Earth's).[43] Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes such as Olympus
                            Mons and rift valleys such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have
                            persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago.[44] Its red colour comes from iron oxide
                            (rust) in its soil.[45] Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to
                            be captured asteroids.[46]
