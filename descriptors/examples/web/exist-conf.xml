    <!-- Configures the cluster configuration
        - protocol:
        defines a protocol stack. Refers the jgroups protocol stack.
        - dbaUser:

        - dbaPassword:
        defines the user password used by the cluster for the replica.

    <!-- Configures the database backend:
        - database:
            selects a database backend. Currently, "native" and "native_cluster"
            are the only valid setting.
        - files:
            path to the directory where database files are
            stored.
        - cacheSize:
            the maximum amount of memory to use for database page buffers.
            Each database file has an associated page buffer for B+-tree and
            data pages. However, the memory specified via cacheSize is shared
            between all page buffers. It represents an absolute maximum, which
            would be occupied if all page buffers were completely full.
        - free_mem_min:
            minimum amount of free memory in percent during indexing. The
            database will start to flush its internal buffers whenever
            free memory drops below the specified limit.
        - pageSize:
            the size of one page on the disk. This is the smallest unit
            transferred from and to the database files. Should be a multiple of
            the operating system's file system page size (usually 4096).
    -->

    <!-- The settings below are very conservative to avoid out-of-memory
    exceptions on machines with limited memory (256MB). Increase the
    buffer settings for elements_buffers and words_buffers if you have
    some more memory to waste. -->

    - enable-xsl:

        when serializing documents?
    - indent:
        should the serializer pretty-print (indent) XML?
    - match-tagging-elements:
    - match-tagging-attributes:

    - add-exist-id:
        for debugging: add an exist:id attribute to every element, showing
        the internal node identifier (as a long int) assigned to this node.
        Possible values are: "none", "element", "all". "all" displays the node
        of every element node; "element" displays the id only for the root nodes
        of the returned XML fragments.

	<!-- During XUpdates, the database needs to do a partial reindex of the
	document whenever the internal node-id structure has changed. Reindex
	runs can occur quite frequently and slow down the XUpdate process.

	Frequent reindex runs can be avoided by leaving some space between the
	numeric identifiers assigned to every node. Future insertions will first
	fill up these spare identifiers, so no reindex is required.

	The "growth-factor" attribute determines the number of spare ids to be
	inserted whenever the node id scheme is recomputed after an XUpdate.
	Increase the setting to have less reindex runs. However, you have to
	be aware that leaving spare ids also limits the maximum size of a
	document that can be indexed.

	"enable-consistency-checks" is for debugging only. If the parameter
	is set to "yes", a consistency check will be run on every modified
	document after every XUpdate request. It checks if the
	persistent DOM is complete and all pointers in the structural
	index point to valid storage addresses containing valid nodes.

    "allowed-fragmentation" defines the maximum number of page splits allowed within a
    document before a defragmentation run will be triggered.

        Settings for the indexer:
        - suppress-whitespace
            should leading or trailing whitespace be removed from a text
            node? Set to "leading", "trailing", "both" or "none". Changing
            the parameter will only have an effect on newly loaded files, not
            old ones.
        - caseSensitive
            should equality comparisons between strings be case-sensitive or
            insensitive: "yes" or "no".
        - validation
            should XML source files be validated against a schema or DTD before
            storing them? The setting is passed to the XML parser. The actual
            effects depend on the parser you use. eXist comes with Xerces which can
            validate against both: schemas and DTDs. Possible values: "yes",
            "no", "auto". "auto" will leave validation to the parser.
        - stemming
            eXist includes a very simple english language stemmer, based on Porter's algorithm.
            Set the "stemming"-option to "true" if you would like to use stemming. This does
            only work for english.
        - index-depth
            defines the maximum nesting depth of nodes which will be indexed
            in the DOM index. Nodes below the specified nesting depth will
            not be indexed in the DOM file. This has only an effect when
            retrieving query results or for some types of XPath subexpressions, like
            equality comparisons.
