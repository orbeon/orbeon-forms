         * The code below reads the input in a SAX store, before replaying the SAX store to the

         *
         * This may seem inefficient, but it is necessary (unfortunately) so the URI resolver which will be
         * called by the XInclude content handler has the right parents in the stack. When we do
         * readInputAsSAX() here, this might run a processor PR which might be outside of the current
         * pipeline PI that executed the XInclude processor. When PR run, PI might not be in the processor
         * stack anymore, because it is possible for PR to be outside of PI. When PR calls a SAX method of
         * the XInclude handler, there is no executeChildren() that runs, so when the XInclude handler
         * method is called the parent stack might not include PI, and so reading an input of PI will fail.
         *
         * The general rule is that when you receive SAX events, you might not be in the right context.
         * While the readInput...() method is running you can't rely on having the right context, so you
         * shouldn't call other readInput...() methods or do anything that relies on the context.
         *
         * We don't have this problem with Saxon, because Saxon will first read the input stylesheet and
         * then processes it. So when the processing happens, the readInput...() methods that reads the
         * stylesheet has returned.
