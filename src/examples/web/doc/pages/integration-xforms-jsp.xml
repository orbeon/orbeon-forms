                Most of the examples shipped with PresentationServer use the page flow controller
                and are implemented using other components of PresentationServer. It is also
                possible to use the XForms engine without using the page flow controller. The
                PresentationServer web archive (WAR file) comes with examples implemented in JSP
                files that reply on the XForms engine and we describe here how you can use just the
                XForms engine. We illustrate our case using JSPs, but this largely applies to
                servlets or third party web frameworks implemented as a servlet.

            <p>
                In the PresentationServer web archive (WAR file), all the JSPs are in a directory
                called xforms-jsp. Under this directory, there is one distinct subdirectory per
                example, for instance: xforms-jsp/guess-the-number or xforms-jsp/flickr-search.
                Instead of generating plain HTML, JSP files will generate XHTML + XForms, which is
                then transformed by PresentationServer in HTML that the browser can understand. This
                is done with the help of a filter declared in the web.xml. In the PresentationServer
                web.xml, it is declared as follow:
            </p>
            <xml-source>
                <filter>
                    <filter-name>ops-main-filter</filter-name>
                    <filter-class>org.orbeon.oxf.servlet.OXFServletFilter</filter-class>
                    <init-param>
                        <param-name>oxf.main-processor.name</param-name>
                        <param-value>{http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/processors}pipeline</param-value>
                    </init-param>
                    <init-param>
                        <param-name>oxf.main-processor.input.config</param-name>
                        <param-value>oxf:/config/filter.xpl</param-value>
                    </init-param>
                    <init-param>
                        <param-name>oxf.error-processor.name</param-name>
                        <param-value>{http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/processors}pipeline</param-value>
                    </init-param>
                    <init-param>
                        <param-name>oxf.error-processor.input.config</param-name>
                        <param-value>oxf:/ops/xforms/xforms-server-error.xpl</param-value>
                    </init-param>
                </filter>
                <filter-mapping>
                    <filter-name>ops-main-filter</filter-name>
                    <url-pattern>/xforms-jsp/*</url-pattern>
                </filter-mapping>
            </xml-source>
            <p>
                The most important part is the url-pattern defined under
                <code>&lt;filter-mapping></code>. It reads: <code>/xforms-jsp/*</code>. This means
                that all the data generated by URL that starts with <code>/xforms-jsp/</code> will
                be post-processed by PresentationServer. We tell PresentationServer what
                post-processing needs to happen in the web.xml: here we run the pipeline
                <code>oxf:/config/filter.xpl</code>, which applies the epilogue on the data
                generated by JSP. The epilogue will transform XHTML + XForms into HTML and in some
                cases apply a theme.

            <title>Generating XHTML and XForms in JSP</title>
            <p>
                The JSP generates XHTML + XForms, like a view linked from the page flow would. To be
                recognized as XHTML, you need to set the appropriate content type in your JSP by
                calling response.setContentType("application/xhtml+xml"). So your JSP will
                typically look like:
            </p>
            <xml-source>
                &lt;% response.setContentType("application/xhtml+xml"); %>
                <xhtml:html xmlns:xforms="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms"
                    xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
                    xmlns:ev="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events">

                    <xhtml:head>
                        <xhtml:title>Guess The Number</xhtml:title>
                        <xforms:model>
                            <xforms:instance>
                                ...
                            </xforms:instance>
                        </xforms:model>
                    </xhtml:head>
                    <xhtml:body>
                        <xhtml:h1>My Page</xhtml:h1>
                        <xforms:input ref="..."/>
                        ...
                    </xhtml:body>
                </xhtml:html>
            </xml-source>

            <title>Implementing XForms Services with JSP</title>
            <p>
                The backend of your forms is implemented in what we loosely call "services", that is
                URLs that can be used with an <code>&lt;xforms:submission></code>. Most of the time,
                XML is being posted to the service and XML is returned by the service. Since
                services take XML as input and generate XML, XPL is an ideal tool to implement
                services. However, you can also use JSP. If you do, one of the first thing you will
                want to do in your JSP file is to set the appropriate content type for the reponse:
                <code>response.setContentType("application/xml")</code>. Using the dom4j API, you
                can create an object that represents the posted document with: <code>Document
                queryDocument = xmlReader.read(request.getInputStream())</code>. You will then use
                this object to gather data about the query sent to your service.
            </p>
            <p>
                In XForms you reference the service implemented with JSP in the action attribute of
                <code>&lt;xforms:submission></code>, as usual. For instance:
            </p>
            <xml-source>
                <xforms:submission id="do-query" method="post" replace="instance"
                        ref="instance('query')"
                        instance="photos" action="/xforms-jsp/flickr-search/service-search.jsp"/>
            </xml-source>
