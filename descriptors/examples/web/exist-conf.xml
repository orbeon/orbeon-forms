        Configures the database backend:

        - cacheSize:
            the maximum amount of memory to use for database page buffers.
            Each database file has an associated page buffer for B+-tree and
            data pages. However, the memory specified via cacheSize is shared
            between all page buffers. It represents an absolute maximum, which
            would be occupied if all page buffers were completely full.

            The cacheSize should not be more than half of the size of the JVM
            heap size (set by the JVM -Xmx parameter).

        - collectionCacheSize:
            not documented.

        - database:
            selects a database backend. Currently, "native" and "native_cluster"
            are the only valid setting.

        - files:
            path to the directory where database files are stored.

        - free_mem_min:
            minimum amount of free memory in percent during indexing. The
            database will start to flush its internal buffers whenever
            free memory drops below the specified limit.

        - pageSize:
            the size of one page on the disk. This is the smallest unit
            transferred from and to the database files. Should be a multiple of
            the operating system's file system page size (usually 4096).

        =====================================================================

        The settings below are very conservative to avoid out-of-memory
        exceptions on machines with limited memory (256MB).

        Increase the buffer settings for elements_buffers and words_buffers if
        you have some more memory to waste. If you deal with lots of
        collections, you can also increase the collectionCacheSize value

            and hanging processes. For this to work correctly, all database
            operations must be logged to a journal file.

            - enabled:

            - group-commit:
                not documented.

            - journal-dir:
                this attribute sets the directory where journal files are to be
                written. If no directory is specified, the default path is to
                the data directory.

            - size:
                this attributes sets the maximum allowed size of the journal
                file. Once the journal reaches this limit, a checkpoint will be
                triggered and the journal will be cleaned. However, the database
                waits for running transactions to return before processing this
                checkpoint. In the event one of these transactions writes a lot
                of data to the journal file, the file will grow until the
                transaction has completed. Hence, the size limit is not enforced
                in all cases.

            - sync-on-commit:
                this attribute determines whether or not to protect the journal
                during operating system failures. That is, it determines whether
                the database forces a file-sync on the journal after every
                commit.
                If this attribute is set to "yes", the journal is protected
                against operating system failures. However, this will slow
                performance - especially on Windows systems.
                If set to "no", eXist will rely on the operating system to flush
                out the journal contents to disk. In the worst case scenario,
                in which there is a complete system failure, some committed
                transactions might not have yet been written to the journal,
                and so will be rolled back.

            Example: <security> class Attribute (LDAP)
            <security class="org.exist.security.LDAPSecurityManager" />

            eXist is distributed with the following built-in security manager
            implementations:

            - org.exist.security.XMLSecurityManager

                stores the user information in the database. This is the
                default manager if the <security> element is not included
                in <db-connection>.

            - org.exist.security.LDAPSecurityManager

                retrieves the user and groups from the LDAP database. This
                requires addition configuration parameters which are
                described in the LDAP Security Manager documentation.

                    applies plain encryption.

                - md5: (default)
                    applies the MD5 algorithm to encrypt passwords.

                - simple-md5:
                    applies a simplified MD5 algorithm to encrypt passwords.

            - password-realm:

            watchdog monitors all query processes, and can terminate any
            long-running queries if they exceed one of the predefined limits.
            These limits are as follows:

            - output-size-limit
                this attribute limits the size of XML fragments constructed
                using XQuery, and thus sets the maximum amount of main memory a
                query is allowed to use. This limit is expressed as the maximum
                number of nodes allowed for an in-memory DOM tree. The purpose
                of this option is to avoid memory shortages on the server in
                cases where users are allowed to run queries that produce very
                large output fragments.

            - query-timeout
                this attribute sets the maximum amount of time (expressed in

        - index-depth
            defines the maximum nesting depth of nodes which will be indexed
            in the DOM index. Nodes below the specified nesting depth will
            not be indexed in the DOM file. This has only an effect when
            retrieving query results or for some types of XPath subexpressions,
            like equality comparisons.

        - stemming
            eXist includes a very simple english language stemmer, based on
            Porter's algorithm. Set the "stemming"-option to "true" if you
            would like to use stemming. This does only work for english.

        - suppress-whitespace
            should leading or trailing whitespace be removed from a text node?
            Set to "leading", "trailing", "both" or "none".
            Changing the parameter will only have an effect on newly loaded
            files, not old ones.

        - suppress-whitespace-mixed-content
            preserve the white space inside a mixed content node

        - tokenizer:
            this attribute invokes the Java class used to tokenize a string into
            a sequence of single words or tokens, which are stored to the
            fulltext index. Currently only the SimpleTokenizer is available.

        - track-term-freq:

        - validation:
            should XML source files be validated against a schema or DTD before
            storing them? The setting is passed to the XML parser. The actual
            effects depend on the parser you use. eXist comes with Xerces which
            can validate against both: schemas and DTDs.
            Possible values: "yes", "no", "auto". "auto" will leave validation

        Default settings for the serializer. Most of these can be changed
        by client code:

        - add-exist-id:
            for debugging: add an exist:id attribute to every element, showing
            the internal node identifier (as a long int) assigned to this node.
            Possible values are: "none", "element", "all". "all" displays the
            node of every element node; "element" displays the id only for the
            root nodes of the returned XML fragments.

       - compress-output:
           should the output be compressed when serializing documents?
           Sometimes useful with remote clients.
           Remember to add a statement like this to your client code:
           service.setProperty("compress-output", "yes");
           to uncompress the retrieved result in the client too.

        - enable-xinclude:
            should the database expand XInclude tags by default?

        - enable-xsl:
            should the database evaluate XSL processing instructions
            when serializing documents?

        - indent:
            should the serializer pretty-print (indent) XML?

        - match-tagging-attributes:
            matches for attribute values can also be tagged using the character
            sequence "||" to demarcate the matching text string. Since this
            changes the content of the attribute value, the feature is disabled
            by default.

        - match-tagging-elements:
            the database can highlight matches in the text content of a node by
            tagging the matching text string with <exist:match> . Clearly, this
            only works for XPath expressions using the fulltext index.

            Set the parameter to "yes" to disable this feature.

        During XUpdates, the database needs to do a partial reindex of the
      document whenever the internal node-id structure has changed. Reindex
      runs can occur quite frequently and slow down the XUpdate process.

      Frequent reindex runs can be avoided by leaving some space between the
      numeric identifiers assigned to every node. Future insertions will first
      fill up these spare identifiers, so no reindex is required.

        - allowed-fragmentation:
            defines the maximum number of page splits allowed within a document
            before a defragmentation run will be triggered.

      - enable-consistency-checks:
            for debugging only. If the parameter is set to "yes", a consistency
            check will be run on every modified document after every XUpdate
            request. It checks if the persistent DOM is complete and all
            pointers in the structural index point to valid storage addresses
            containing valid nodes.

        - growth-factor:
            determines the number of spare ids to be inserted whenever the node
            id scheme is recomputed after an XUpdate.
            Increase the setting to have less reindex runs. However, you have
            to be aware that leaving spare ids also limits the maximum size of
