// We used to compute a has with `SecureUtils.defaultMessageDigest`. The hash was used for 2
// purposes:
//
// 1. XPathCache uses the hash as part of the cache key
// 2. reducing the number of namespace objects in `XFormsAnnotator` and `Metadata`.
//
// Now we address #2 by using Scala immutable maps. This doesn't reduce the number of objects as much
// has using a strong hash and reusing the `NamespaceMapping` but it's good enough, and we don't need
// the hash anymore for this.
//
// Remains #1, the hash from `hashCode` is computed with MurmurHash 3, which is not as strong but
// should hopefully be enough to discriminate expressions in the cache which are identical except
// for the namespaces in scope.
