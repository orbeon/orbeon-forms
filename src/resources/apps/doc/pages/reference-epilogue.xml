            <p>
                The Orbeon Forms <i>page flow epilogue</i> is an <a href="reference-xpl-pipelines">XPL pipeline</a>
                executed by the <a href="reference-page-flow">Page Flow Controller</a> (PFC) in order to perform tasks
                common to all the pages in an Orbeon Forms application. Such tasks include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Document-aware formatting.</b> Formatting the document differently depending on the type of
                        document produced by a page view, for example XHTML or XSL-FO.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Client-aware formatting.</b> Producing XHTML or plain HTML depending on the user agent
                        requesting the page, or different versions of HTML depending on different clients.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Server-side XForms processing.</b> The Orbeon Forms server-side XForms engine is
                        hooked up in the epilogue.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>
                        <b>User-defined configuration.</b> Finally, because the epilogue is a configurable XPL
                        pipeline, there is no limit to the tasks it can acomplish!

            <p>
                Thanks to the page flow epilogue, it is not necessary to duplicate common behavior in all the page
                views of a given Orbeon Forms application.

                    The epilogue pipeline is specified with the <a
                    href="reference-page-flow#epilogue-element"><code>&lt;epilogue&gt;</code> element</a> in your page
                    flow. By default, the <i>standard epilogue</i> located under <code>oxf:/config/epilogue.xpl</code>
                    is used.

                <p>
                    The epilogue is executed by the PFC only after a page view executes. This means
                    that for a given execution of a page, the following conditions must be met for the
                    epilogue to execute:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> elements has a <code>view</code> attribute.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            No page result element with a <code>page</code> attribute executes
                            (because in that case, a redirection to another page occurs, and neither
                            model nor view of the current page executes).
                        </p>

                                When executed, the epilogue XPL pipeline has a <code>data</code> input containing
                                the XML document produced by the page view which just executed. In particular, if
                                the page view is:

                    <code>oxf:/config/epilogue-portlet.xpl</code> is the epilogue file used for the
                    examples portal. You usually do not have to worry about this XPL pipeline unless
                    you add new examples, or unless you deploy as a JSR-168 portlet.

                    <code>epilogue-portlet.xpl</code> has the same inputs as the

                    <code>epilogue-portlet.xpl</code> performs different tasks depending on the input

                            resources such as images, PDF files, etc.

            <title>XForms Processing</title>
            <p>
                The Orbeon Forms built-in <a href="reference-xforms-ng">XForms engine</a> allows you to write
                not only raw XHTML, but also supports XForms 1.0. To achieve this, the XForms engine
                rewrites XHTML + XForms into XHTML + JavaScript + CSS. This transformation also
                occurs in the epilogue, as mentioned <a href="#standard-epilogue">above</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is not necessary to know in details the work performed by the XForms
                engine, it is important to know that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        XForms processing is triggered when either a legacy XForms model is found on
                        the <code>xforms-model</code> input of the epilogue, or when an XForms model
                        is found under <code>/xhtml:html/xhtml:head</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The result of XForms processing is that all the elements in the XForms namespace are removed,
                        including the XForms models you may have under <code>xhtml:head</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Instead of XForms elements, you will find XHTML elements. Those elements may use some CSS
                        classes defined in <code>xforms.css</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The theme includes some default Orbeon Forms CSS stylesheets and copies over JavaScript and
                        CSS resources produced by the XForms engine.
                    </p>

            <title>Theming</title>
            <p>
                As documented above, the theme stylesheet is called only for views that generate XHTML documents. The
                theme does not run, for example, on pseudo-HTML, XSL-FO, or plain XML documents. However, you can still
                produce HTML documents and use a theme stylesheet, since the epilogue is able to convert XHTML to HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orbeon Forms comes with two stylesheets: <code>theme-plain.xsl</code> and <code>theme-portal.xsl</code>.
                <code>theme-plain.xsl</code> only makes minor adjustments to your page view. You can simplify it
                further, or expand it. <code>theme-portal.xsl</code> is the theme for the built-in Orbeon Forms example
                applications. It decorates pages views with a list of available example applications, and provides a
                mechanism for viewing application source code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Orbeon Forms theme resources are found under the <code>oxf:/config/theme</code> directory. They are
                referred to, directly or indirectly (through CSS) from the <code>theme-*.xsl</code> stylesheets called
                from the epilogue XPL pipelines. The following should be noted:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Theme stylesheets copy, under <code>xhtml:head</code>, the <code>xhtml:meta</code>,
                        <code>xhtml:link</code>, <code>xhtml:style</code>, and <code>xhtml:script</code> elements from
                        the source XHTML document. This allows you for example to link to a particular JavaScript
                        script on a page by page basis, instead of including the script in all the pages of your
                        application.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Theme stylesheets add, under <code>xhtml:head</code>, a link to the Orbeon Forms CSS
                        stylesheet:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>orbeon.css.</b> This contains definitions proprietary to the default theme. You will
                                probably not use this CSS stylesheet in your own theme stylesheet.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        When XForms is used, theme stylesheets indirectly add, under <code>xhtml:head</code>, a link to
                        the Orbeon Forms XForms resources, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>xforms.css.</b> These are definitions related to XForms controls. These
                                definitions may be changed by users if they are not happy with the defaults.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>xforms-widgets.css.</b> These are definitions related to XForms
                                pseudo-controls created by the <code>xforms-widgets.xsl</code> stylesheet. These
                                definitions may be changed by users if they are not happy with the defaults.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Other XForms CSS and JavaScript resources</b>. These are usually added by the XForms
                                engine as needed.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Theme stylesheets generate, under <code>xhtml:head</code>, an <code>xhtml:title</code> element,
                        first by looking in the XHTML document if present. If not found, it looks for a
                        <code>f:example-header</code> element (this element is used by some Orbeon Forms examples).
                        Finally, it looks for the first <code>xhtml:h1</code> element in the body of the XHTML document.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Theme stylesheets processes the source <code>xhtml:body</code> element. This mostly results in
                        copying the content of the source <code>xhtml:body</code>, with the exception that attribute in
                        the XHTML namespace are copied but in no namespace.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can configure the standard theme at your leisure for your own application. You typically get started
                by modifying <code>theme-plain.xsl</code> and/or referring to your own stylesheet from the epilogue
                pipeline.
