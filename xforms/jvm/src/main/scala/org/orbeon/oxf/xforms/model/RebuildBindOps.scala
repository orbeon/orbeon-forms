  // bind may be a target element that is associated with more than one target bind object.

  // If a target bind element is outermost, or if all of its ancestor bind elements have nodeset attributes that
  // select only one node, then the target bind only has one associated bind object, so this is the desired target
  // bind object whose nodeset is used in the Single Node Binding or Node Set Binding. Otherwise, the in-scope
  // evaluation context node of the source object containing the bind attribute is used to help select the appropriate
  // target bind object from among those associated with the target bind element.
  //
  // From among the bind objects associated with the target bind element, if there exists a bind object created with
  // the same in-scope evaluation context node as the source object, then that bind object is the desired target bind
