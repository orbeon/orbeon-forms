        Configures the database backend:

        - cacheSize:
            the maximum amount of memory to use for database page buffers.
            Each database file has an associated page buffer for B+-tree and
            data pages. However, the memory specified via cacheSize is shared
            between all page buffers. It represents an absolute maximum, which
            would be occupied if all page buffers were completely full.

            The cacheSize should not be more than half of the size of the JVM
            heap size (set by the JVM -Xmx parameter).

        - collectionCache:
            maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) to use for collection caches.
            Memory calculation is just approximate. If your collections are very different
            in size, it might be possible that the actual amount of memory used exceeds
            the specified limit. You should thus be careful with this setting.

        - database:
            selects a database backend. Currently, "native" and "native_cluster"
            are the only valid setting.

        - files:
            path to the directory where database files are stored.

        - pageSize:
            the size of one page on the disk. This is the smallest unit
            transferred from and to the database files. Should be a multiple of
            the operating system's file system page size (usually 4096).

        =====================================================================

        The settings below are very conservative to avoid out-of-memory
        exceptions on machines with limited memory (256MB).

        Increase the buffer settings for elements_buffers and words_buffers if
        you have some more memory to waste. If you deal with lots of
        collections, you can also increase the collectionCacheSize value

            Settings for the journaling and recovery of the database. With
            recovery enabled, the database is able to recover from an unclean
            database shutdown due to, for example, power failures, OS reboots,
            and hanging processes. For this to work correctly, all database
            operations must be logged to a journal file.

            - enabled:
                if this attribute is set to yes, automatic recovery is enabled.

            - journal-dir:
                this attribute sets the directory where journal files are to be
                written. If no directory is specified, the default path is to
                the data directory.

            - size:
                this attributes sets the maximum allowed size of the journal
                file. Once the journal reaches this limit, a checkpoint will be
                triggered and the journal will be cleaned. However, the database
                waits for running transactions to return before processing this
                checkpoint. In the event one of these transactions writes a lot
                of data to the journal file, the file will grow until the
                transaction has completed. Hence, the size limit is not enforced
                in all cases.

            - sync-on-commit:
                this attribute determines whether or not to protect the journal
                during operating system failures. That is, it determines whether
                the database forces a file-sync on the journal after every
                commit.
                If this attribute is set to "yes", the journal is protected
                against operating system failures. However, this will slow
                performance - especially on Windows systems.
                If set to "no", eXist will rely on the operating system to flush
                out the journal contents to disk. In the worst case scenario,
                in which there is a complete system failure, some committed
                transactions might not have yet been written to the journal,
                and so will be rolled back.

            - group-commit:
                If set to "yes", eXist will not sync the journal file
                immediately after every transaction commit. Instead,
                it will wait until the current file buffer (32kb)
                is really full. This can speed up eXist on some systems
                where a file sync is an expensive operation (mainly windows
                XP; not necessary on Linux). However, group-comit="yes"
                will increase the risk of an already committed
                operation being rolled back after a database crash.

                - org.exist.security.LDAPSecurityManager

                retrieves the user and groups from the LDAP database. This

                password encoding can be set to one of the following types:

                - plain:
                    applies plain encryption.

            This is the global configuration for the query watchdog. The
            watchdog monitors all query processes, and can terminate any
            long-running queries if they exceed one of the predefined limits.
            These limits are as follows:

            - output-size-limit
                this attribute limits the size of XML fragments constructed
                using XQuery, and thus sets the maximum amount of main memory a
                query is allowed to use. This limit is expressed as the maximum
                number of nodes allowed for an in-memory DOM tree. The purpose
                of this option is to avoid memory shortages on the server in
                cases where users are allowed to run queries that produce very
                large output fragments.

            - query-timeout
                this attribute sets the maximum amount of time (expressed in
                milliseconds) that the query can take before it is killed..

            should equality comparisons between strings be case-sensitive or
            insensitive: "yes" or "no".

        - index-depth:
            defines the maximum nesting depth of nodes which will be indexed
            in the DOM index. Nodes below the specified nesting depth will
            not be indexed in the DOM file. This has only an effect when
            retrieving query results or for some types of XPath subexpressions,
            like equality comparisons.

        - stemming:
            eXist includes a very simple english language stemmer, based on
            Porter's algorithm. Set the "stemming"-option to "true" if you
            would like to use stemming. This does only work for english.

        - suppress-whitespace:
            should leading or trailing whitespace be removed from a text node?
            Set to "leading", "trailing", "both" or "none".
            Changing the parameter will only have an effect on newly loaded

	            these jobs are synchronous.

	            system - System jobs require the database to be in a consistent state.
	            All database operations will be stopped until the method returns or
	            throws an exception. Any exception will be caught and a warning written to
	            the log.

	            user - User jobs may be scheduled at any time and may be mutually exclusive
	            or non-exclusive

            - class:

            	org.exist.storage.SystemTask

            - xquery:
            If the job is written in XQuery (not suitable for system jobs) then this should
            be a path to an XQuery stored in the database. e.g. /db/myCollection/myJob.xql
            XQuery job's will be launched under the guest account initially,

        Default settings for the serializer. Most of these can be changed
        by client code:

        - add-exist-id:
            for debugging: add an exist:id attribute to every element, showing
            the internal node identifier (as a long int) assigned to this node.
            Possible values are: "none", "element", "all". "all" displays the
            node of every element node; "element" displays the id only for the
            root nodes of the returned XML fragments.

       - compress-output:
           should the output be compressed when serializing documents?
           Sometimes useful with remote clients.
           Remember to add a statement like this to your client code:
           service.setProperty("compress-output", "yes");
           to uncompress the retrieved result in the client too.

        - enable-xinclude:
            should the database expand XInclude tags by default?

        - enable-xsl:
            should the database evaluate XSL processing instructions
            when serializing documents?

        - indent:
            should the serializer pretty-print (indent) XML?

        - match-tagging-attributes:
            matches for attribute values can also be tagged using the character
            sequence "||" to demarcate the matching text string. Since this
            changes the content of the attribute value, the feature is disabled
            by default.

        - match-tagging-elements:
            the database can highlight matches in the text content of a node by
            tagging the matching text string with <exist:match>. Clearly, this
            only works for XPath expressions using the fulltext index.

            Set the parameter to "yes" to enable this feature.

    -->

        Default settings for the XSLT Transformer. Allow's for a choice of
        implementation:

        - class:
            the name of the class that implements javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory

            for Saxon (XSLT 2.0 support) - net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl

                You will need to copy saxon8.jar saxon8-dom.jar and saxon8-xpath.jar
                into lib/endorsed.
                You can get these from http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon

            for Xalan (XSLT 1.0 support) - org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl


        For further details see - http://atomic.exist-db.org/wiki/HowTo/XSLT2/

        You can also include attribute child elements, if you wish to pass in attributes
        to your particular TransformerFactory as follows:

            <transformer class="net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl">
                <attribute name="http://saxon.sf.net/feature/version-warning" value="false" type="boolean"/>
            </transformer>

        The example above sets Saxon to suppress warnings when executing a XSLT 1.0 stylesheet
        with the XLST 2.0 processor. Check the documentation for your selected TransformerFactory
        to determine which attributes can be set. Valid types include "boolean", "integer"
        and "string".  Anything else will be treated as type "string".

        Settings for XML validation
        - mode
            should XML source files be validated against a schema or DTD before
            storing them? The setting is passed to the XML parser. The actual
            effects depend on the parser you use. eXist comes with Xerces which
            can validate against both: schemas and DTDs.

            Possible values: "yes", "no", "auto". "auto" will leave validation
            to the parser.
